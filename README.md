# Casesar Cipher

## About

The Caesar cipher is an ancient encryption algorithm used by Julius Caesar. It encrypts letters 
by shifting them over by a certain number of places in the alphabet. We call the length of shift 
the key. For example, if the key is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and so on. To 
decrypt the message, you must shift the encrypted letters in the opposite direction. This program 
lets the user encrypt and decrypt messages according to this algorithm.
